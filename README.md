# Pimcore Customer Management Framework

Pimcore allows to manage any kind of data - unstructured, digital assets and structured content. The most obvious structured content is product data and all data related to products like categories, technologies, brands, etc. 
The built-in E-Commerce Framework supports building e-commerce applications and managing transactional data like orders. The third big group of structured data besides products and transactions is customer data. 

The **Customer Management Framework (CMF)** for Pimcore adds new functionality for customer data management, segmentation, personalization and marketing automation. It allows aggregating customer data and user profiles, enriching data, linking social profiles, building audience segments, triggering events, personalizing experience, executing marketing automation, and much more.

Like Pimcore itself and the E-Commerce-Framework, the CMF is also a Framework for developers to develop customer management solutions and is tightly integrated into the Pimcore Core functionality. 

## Provided Functionality in a Nutshell
- Customer Data Management based on Pimcore Data Objects.
- Storage of Customer Activities from different data feeds.
- Customer Segmentation based on data, activities and other criteria.
- Duplicate detection and merging.
- Enhancement of Pimcore's on-site personalization.
- Marketing Automation with built-in rule engine and triggers.
- Default integration to external newsletter systems like MailChimp.
- Rest API for integration of external systems for data import or export.
